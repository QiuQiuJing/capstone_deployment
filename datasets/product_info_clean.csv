A daily gel cleanser with natural fruit exfoliant that thoroughly but gently lifts impurities and unclogs pores while leaving skin soft and hydrated.

Solutions for:
- Pores
- Dullness and uneven texture
- Oiliness

If you want to know more…
The Deep Cleanse oil-free gel lathers into a creamy foam to lift away dirt, oil, and impurities without over-drying. It cleanses with amino acids derived from silk gentle enough for even the most delicate skin, leaving skin soft, refreshed, and comfortably hydrated.

The formula harnesses the power of the Japanese luffa fruit, a natural beauty multitasker beloved by Japanese women for centuries. Ground fibers from the fruit exfoliate, helping to turn over dead skin cells while purifying and decongesting pores. The fruit extract also beautifies and conditions skin. Japanese wild rose works to visibly tighten pores and smooth skin texture, while Japanese leopard lily helps minimize excess oil.

What else you need to know:
Harvested under a full autumn moon, the water of luffa fruit has been prized as a favorite natural skincare ingredient in Japan since the Edo period. It is beloved for its clarifying and moisturizing properties. When dried and ground, the fruit gently exfoliates to purify and smooth skin texture—the original inspiration for the modern day loofah sponge. The Deep Cleanse harnesses this time-tested ingredient in this refreshing, easy-to-use daily exfoliating cleanser.

This pure, oil-free formula is non-irritating, non-sensitizing, dermatologist tested, and cruelty-free. It is formulated without synthetic fragrances, sulfate detergents, urea, DEA, of TEA.

What else you need to know:
Beste™ No. 9 is formulated at an ideal, non-stripping pH level of 5.5.

100 percent free of essential oils, silicones, and fragrance.

Note: In Afrikaans, Beste means Best. Even though the first eight versions weren’t exactly that, Drunk Elephant thinks they’ve finally found the best one yet. They are calling it Beste™ No. 9 after going through nine formulations to get there! Only the Beste will do.

Note from Tiffany Masterson, Drunk Elephant Founder: ""We took your feedback about the original Beste and made some changes—we swapped out the twist top packaging for a trusty flip top and tweaked the formula so it’s gentle enough to use on eyes (and remove every last trace of makeup).""

Drunk Elephant is committed to using only ingredients that either directly benefit the skin’s health or support the integrity and effectiveness of our formulations. They never take into account an ingredient’s synthetic or natural status, but instead choose based on its biocompatibility. You won’t find what they call the ""Suspicious 6"" in their products (essential oils, drying alcohols, silicones, chemical screens, fragrance/dyes, and SLS,) making them, in their opinion, appropriate for all skin. They believe that these six ubiquitous ingredients are at the root of almost every skin issue we see. When formulating the products, they focus on pH levels and safety, and always making sure that the active ingredients are at efficacious levels. This is the Drunk Elephant difference.

Drunk Elephant is a supporter of IEF (International Elephant Foundation) and is cruelty-free.

Drunk Elephant is committed to using only ingredients that either directly benefit the skin’s health or support the integrity and effectiveness of our formulations. They never take into account an ingredient’s synthetic or natural status, but instead choose based on its biocompatibility. You won’t find what they call the ""Suspicious 6"" in their products (essential oils, drying alcohols, silicones, chemical screens, fragrance/dyes, and SLS,) making them, in their opinion, appropriate for all skin. They believe that these six ubiquitous ingredients are at the root of almost every skin issue we see. When formulating the products, they focus on pH levels and safety, and always making sure that the active ingredients are at efficacious levels. This is the Drunk Elephant difference.

Drunk Elephant is a supporter of IEF (International Elephant Foundation) and is cruelty-free.

Drunk Elephant is committed to using only ingredients that either directly benefit the skin’s health or support the integrity and effectiveness of our formulations. They never take into account an ingredient’s synthetic or natural status, but instead choose based on its biocompatibility. You won’t find what they call the ""Suspicious 6"" in their products (essential oils, drying alcohols, silicones, chemical screens, fragrance/dyes, and SLS,) making them, in their opinion, appropriate for all skin. They believe that these six ubiquitous ingredients are at the root of almost every skin issue we see. When formulating the products, they focus on pH levels and safety, and always making sure that the active ingredients are at efficacious levels. This is the Drunk Elephant difference.

Drunk Elephant is a supporter of IEF (International Elephant Foundation) and is cruelty-free.

Drunk Elephant is committed to using only ingredients that either directly benefit the skin’s health or support the integrity and effectiveness of their formulations. They never take into account an ingredient’s synthetic or natural status, but instead choose based on its biocompatibility. You won’t find what Drunk Elephant calls the ""Suspicious 6"" in their products (essential oils, drying alcohols, silicones, chemical screens, fragrance/dyes, and SLS,) making them, in their opinion, appropriate for all skin. They believe that these six ubiquitous ingredients are at the root of almost every skin issue we see. When formulating the products, they focus on pH levels and safety, always making sure that the active ingredients are at efficacious levels. This is the Drunk Elephant difference.

Drunk Elephant is a supporter of IEF (International Elephant Foundation) and is cruelty-free.

An ultra-mild, three-in-one bar that deeply cleanses, subtly exfoliates, and detoxifies for a complexion that is soft and smooth.

Solutions for:

If you want to know more…
This multitasking bar is designed to cleanse effectively while gently removing dead skin cells from the surface of the skin. Drunk Elephant’s unique formulation of thermal mud and bamboo powder creates a wonderful creamy lather that dissolves unwanted oil, rinsing away pore-clogging surface debris and any impurities. It refines skin texture, brightens skin clarity, and over time, helps minimizes the look of pores. 

What else you need to know:
The JuJu Bar is vegan, fragrance- and soap-free, and formulated with skin-friendly ingredients designed to calm and feed the skin while promoting moisture retention. Unlike soap, which has a pH level of 9 or above, the Juju Bar’s ideal pH-level of 6.3 ensures sufficient cleansing without drying or stripping the skin of its protective barrier.

Drunk Elephant is committed to using only ingredients that either directly benefit the skin’s health or support the integrity and effectiveness of our formulations. They never take into account an ingredient’s synthetic or natural status, but instead choose based on its biocompatibility. You won’t find what they call the ""Suspicious 6"" in their products (essential oils, drying alcohols, silicones, chemical screens, fragrance/dyes, and SLS,) making them, in their opinion, appropriate for all skin. They believe that these six ubiquitous ingredients are at the root of almost every skin issue we see. When formulating the products, they focus on pH levels and safety, and always making sure that the active ingredients are at efficacious levels. This is the Drunk Elephant difference.

Drunk Elephant is a supporter of IEF (International Elephant Foundation) and is cruelty-free.

“Tucked away on the top of a hill in central Italy is a small gem of a town called Nocera Umbra. I traveled to this picturesque village almost 18 years ago to discover their hidden secret—Umbrian clay, an ultra-fine mineral-rich clay. This unique clay has been around for centuries and was even used by the ancient Etruscans for its array of benefits. I have been impressed with its versatility and high level of effectiveness ever since my first visit. I am always excited to develop new products that deliver the clay, which I call a ‘miracle ingredient,’ in its purest form. Our newest innovation is a purifying toner which does just that. Ideal for all skin types, I use the toner to gently remove impurities while toning and balancing my skin. The refreshing formula also minimizes the appearance of my pores without drying out my skin, leaving my complexion soft and smooth. I can’t live without it!”—Lev Glazman, Fresh Co-founder

Edible: skin absorbs 60 percent of the substances that we place on it. So, what we put on our body is just as important as what we put in it. Edible Beauty Australia’s gold standard for purity is an edible ingredient list. This means they use only food-grade ingredients to create their range of therapeutic, wildcrafted, botanical skincare. Products are free of alcohol, fragrance, propylene glycol, preservatives, colors, and synthetics, and come packaged in Miron violet glass, which filters damaging UV rays while preserving and activating the botanical ingredients found inside.

Wildcrafted: the use of Australian wildcrafted botanicals raises the therapeutic profile of each and every formula. Found growing in remote and arid regions of Australia, these plants are forced to develop a strong antioxidant defense and preservation system to survive. When used topically, these qualities transfer to your skin, in the form of potent anti-aging, protective, nourishing, and hydrating benefits.

Drunk Elephant is committed to using only ingredients that either directly benefit the skin’s health or support the integrity and effectiveness of our formulations. They never take into account an ingredient’s synthetic or natural status, but instead choose based on its biocompatibility. You won’t find what they call the ""Suspicious 6"" in their products (essential oils, drying alcohols, silicones, chemical screens, fragrance/dyes, and SLS,) making them, in their opinion, appropriate for all skin. They believe that these six ubiquitous ingredients are at the root of almost every skin issue we see. When formulating the products, they focus on pH levels and safety, and always making sure that the active ingredients are at efficacious levels. This is the Drunk Elephant difference.

Ceramides are our skin’s natural protection barrier. They are composed of intercellular lipids that act as skin’s defense against environmental aggressors and maintain moisture levels. Think of your skin as a brick wall: when it is first built, it is strong and sturdy. Over time, it needs fortification to remain strong. As we age, we lose ceramides, leading to a decrease in elasticity and moisture.","-5-Cera Complex: Thoroughly moisturizes and strengthens skin.

Drunk Elephant is committed to using only ingredients that either directly benefit the skin’s health or support the integrity and effectiveness of their formulations. They never take into account an ingredient’s synthetic or natural status, but instead choose based on its biocompatibility. You won’t find what Drunk Elephant calls the ""Suspicious 6"" in their products (essential oils, drying alcohols, silicones, chemical screens, fragrance/dyes, and SLS,) making them, in their opinion, appropriate for all skin. They believe that these six ubiquitous ingredients are at the root of almost every skin issue we see. When formulating the products, they focus on pH levels and safety, always making sure that the active ingredients are at efficacious levels. This is the Drunk Elephant difference.

Drunk Elephant is a supporter of IEF (International Elephant Foundation) and is cruelty-free.

What it is:
A hydrating moisturizer that infuses skin with high-potency, advanced vitamin C (THD ascorbate) to fight the first visible signs of aging while providing powerful antioxidant support.

Solutions for:
- Fine lines and wrinkles
- Dryness

If you want to know more…
C.E.O. C + E Protect and Repair Moisturizer infuses five percent advanced, oxygen-stable tetrahexydecyl ascorbate (THD ascorbate) into the skin—the gold standard form of vitamin C. THD ascorbate is the newer, clinically-proven, oil-soluble derivative of vitamin C, which penetrates better into the skin while being exceptionally stable against oxygenation. With 5 percent THD ascorbate, this moisturizer is powerful at fighting the first visible signs of aging and restoring vital skin radiance, while being uniquely suitable for those with sensitive skin, as THD ascorbate is significantly less irritating than other forms of vitamin C. Once in the skin, it helps boost youthful-looking skin texture and volume, in addition to providing photostable, antioxidant support.

Blended with protective, anti-pollution expopolysaccharides and refining lime pearl extract, this formula visibly repairs the effects of aging, environmental stress, and pollution-induced damage. It is rich yet never greasy, providing hydration and antioxidant protection to the skin for a visibly younger, softer, and healthier-looking complexion.

- Parabens
- Sulfates
